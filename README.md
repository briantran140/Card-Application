# Cards

## Overview

The Cards application is a simple Angular project that displays a list of posts using card components. Each card represents a post with a title, image, username, and content. The application is designed to showcase how to use Angular components, data binding, and input properties.

## Key Features

**Display Posts**: The application displays a list of posts, each with a title, image, username, and content.
**Reusable Card Component**: The application uses a reusable card component to display each post.
**Data Binding**: The application demonstrates the use of Angular's data binding to pass data from the parent component to the child card component.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
